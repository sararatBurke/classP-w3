Requirements for this assignment: 

1. The screen that you create for this should very much resemble the one from above. 
2. The image at the top should either remain as an ImageBackground with a Play button 
(which would open up a modal) over it OR it should be replaced by the static image of a video. 
You may use any of the methods in the example code for this. 
3. The Video accessed by that area should work properly. 
4. Besides being able to access the video from where the image is: 
You should also make it such that a Modal will open up when one of the links 
in the top NavBar is clicked. Make sure one of the links says "PlayVideo" 
and is connected to a function which will open up a Modal containing 
a video (also must work properly).
5. Save to a github repo and pass it in.
